    <h2>Employment History</h2>

    <h4>Kington building supplies: June 2021 - December 2022</h4>
    <p>Working as part of the team at KBS, selling building supplies to customers and giving advice on building materials. 
        Being new to the industry of building presented a unique opportunity to develop and hone my knowledge in the 
        following areas; plastering, concreting, plumbing, electrics, carpentry, slabbing, and joinery. KBS sells a 
        plethora of different building supplies and learning the purpose and application of every one of these projects 
        presented a difficult but absolutely achievable challenge for me. This job showed me that leaving your comfort zone
        and surrounding yourself with new challenges is truly one of the most efficient and effective ways of learning new things.
        The knowledge i learned at this job is going to be something i will carry with me for the rest of my life.</p> 
    

    <h4>Heineken: October 2017 - July 2020</h4>
    <p>Working as one of two cider production apprentices for Heineken in their very first cider production apprentice scheme. 
        I operated the filtering aspect to cider making as well as blending. Two of the most important processes in Heinekens process flow. 
        I was rigorously trained to Heinekens level 5 standard of working with both the filters and the blenders, this meant I was experienced 
        enough to train new apprentices in 2019. I was responsible for filtering all of our tens of thousands of hectolitres of base blend as well 
        as being responsible for conducting my own analysis in Heinekens analytical laboratory, to ensure the product met our strict standards. 
        Blending was the aspect of taking the filtered base blend and adding ingredients to make different ciders, such as Strongbow dark fruits, Bulmers Red and Old Mout.</p>

    <h4>Parklane Farm: August 2017 - October 2017</h4>
    <p>Incisively learning the significance of how to work fast and reliably, packing up to 7000 eggs in 3 hours. We were consistently meeting our production standards by accurately 
        weighing and sorting each individual egg.</p>

    <h4>Burgoynes Marquees: June 2017 - August 2017</h4>
    <p>Learning the value of hard and long work erecting summer marquees for formal events such as weddings and balls; as well as for more recreational occurrences like parties and festivals. 
        Throughout this work I was frequently placed in teams of three to eight people, ultimately allowing me to experience the results of well constructed team work in high pressure and time constricted environments.</p>

    <h4>Lomas Kington Limited: Feburary 2016 - May 2017</h4>
    <p>Confidently worked on the tills as a cashier, as well as answering phone calls and stocking shelves at my local petrol station. During my tenure at this job I was able to hone and develop my skills in time-management and customer relations.
         This resulted in positive feedback from managers and customers.</p>
